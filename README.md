## Comments From Your End:
###  How much time did you spend on the assignment? How was it divided between designing, coding, and testing?
        Since I was totally new to angular I spent most time for learning the basics and some important concepts. For the task 
        I spent most of the time in coding part and less time for designing and testing  
###  What advice should we have given you before you started? 
        Could have mentioned about the Version to be used since every version had some major changes from the other and also 
        could have mentioned about the main component for which we must give more weightage and focus on.
### What was surprising about the assignment? 
        Making a complete end to end application using Angular was itself surprising since it was new to me.
### What was hard about the assignment?
        Understanding the logical errors that I went through in my codebase and rectifying it
